### Introduction to Cega Smart Contracts

Cega V2 has 3 core user-facing contracts:

1. AddressManager

   1.1 AddressManager is a mapping of all relevant contract addresses of the protocol. You should be able to find any necessary contract address through reading this contract.

2. CegaEntry

   2.1 CegaEntry is the root contract users will interface with. Almost all user-facing instructions will go through this contract. This contract has been abstracted away in the SDK, as we look up this address via the AddressManager.

3. Treasury

   3.1 The Treasury is where all the funds are stored. In general, no user should need to interact with this contract directly, except a multi-sig wallet needs to withdraw ETH funds from the contract.

### Getting started with CegaEvmSDKV2

```tsx
import { GasStation, CegaEvmSDKV2 } from '@cega-fi/cega-sdk-evm';

const sdk = new CegaEvmSDKV2(
  addressManager: '0x1DdF7C4C98a78b492bb4a2881358f183d94c9806',
  treasuryAddress: '0xA8AB795731fbBFDd1Fbc57ca11e6f722e7783642',
  gasStation: new GasStation(), // or new EthereumEtherscanGasStation(apiKey), etc.
  provider,
  signer,
)
```

For an example of its usage, check `src/testScripts/sdkV2-scripts.ts`.

### How to sanity test locally
