### Introduction to Cega Smart Contracts

Cega V1 has 3 core contracts:

1. CegaState
2. Product contracts
3. Vault contracts

CegaState is the root contract that contains a list of all products that Cega offers. We currently have multiple types of Product contracts - FCNProduct & LOVProduct, and each product has multiple associated vaults, with different trading periods and with different leverage levels (for LOV).

Some methods are dependent on the product contract type, specified with the suffix (Fcn, Lov), while most other methods are independent of product contract type.

### Introduction to Gas Stations

[See here](GasStation.md)

### Getting started with CegaEvmSDK

```tsx
import { GasStation, CegaEvmSDK } from '@cega-fi/cega-sdk-evm';

const sdk = new CegaEvmSDK(
  '0x0730AA138062D8Cc54510aa939b533ba7c30f26B',
  new GasStation(), // or new EthereumEtherscanGasStation(apiKey), etc.
  provider,
  signer,
);
```

For an example of its usage, check `src/testScripts/sdkV1-getters.ts`.

### How to sanity test locally

1. `$ cp .env.sample .env`
2. Fill in .env file (only used for the test runner)
3. `$ yarn dev-sdkV1`

This will iterate through and get values from the contract address
